Welcome to the JavaScript repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for beginners who are eager to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript. Whether you're new to programming or looking to expand your skills, this repository will provide you with a solid foundation in JavaScript. I have designed multiple projects in Javascript in this repository that are functional. :)

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a powerful and versatile programming language that is primarily used for web development. It allows you to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites, making them more engaging and user-friendly. JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers, making it a crucial tool for front-end web development.


# Projects :
- [Guess My Number Game](https://yyppsk.github.io/JavaScript-Mastering/05-Guess-My-Number/starter/)
- [Dice Roll Game](https://yyppsk.github.io/JavaScript-Mastering/07-Pig-Game/starter/)


## [Guess My Number Game](https://yyppsk.github.io/JavaScript-Mastering/05-Guess-My-Number/starter/)

Guess My Number is a simple interactive game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. In this particular implementation, the number to be guessed falls between 0 and 20. The game provides feedback to the player, indicating whether their guess is too high or too low, helping them narrow down the correct answer. The goal is to guess the number in the fewest attempts possible and achieve the highest score.

To experience the game, please visit the [Guess My Number Game](https://yyppsk.github.io/JavaScript-Mastering/05-Guess-My-Number/starter/) website. Feel free to explore the code and contribute to the project to enhance its features and functionality. Happy guessing!

## [Dice Roll Game](https://yyppsk.github.io/JavaScript-Mastering/07-Pig-Game/starter/)


The Dice Roll Game is an interactive two-player game where each player takes turns rolling a die to accumulate points. The objective is to reach a total score of 50 points. Players can roll the dice multiple times, and each roll adds to their current score. However, if a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose their accumulated points for that turn. The game continues until one of the players reaches the target score of 50, resulting in victory. It's a fun and competitive game that tests luck and strategic decision-making.

## Key Features of JavaScript

- **Easy to Learn:** JavaScript has a syntax similar to other popular programming languages, such as Java and C, making it relatively easy to pick up for beginners.

- **Versatile:** JavaScript can be used for both front-end and back-end development. It allows you to create dynamic web pages, build web applications, develop server-side applications, and even create mobile apps using frameworks like React Native.

- **Interactivity:** JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to your web pages by responding to user actions. You can create interactive forms, validate user inputs, and enhance user experience through animations and effects.

- **Extensibility:** JavaScript is highly extensible through the use of libraries and frameworks. You can leverage popular libraries like jQuery and frameworks like React.js and Vue.js to streamline your development process and build more complex applications.
